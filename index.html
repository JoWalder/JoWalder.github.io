		<h1>Math</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>A few days ago, I wrote to you a bit about casting a double to an int and I included Math.random() into my discussion. I thought you might want to know a little more about it.  I am going break it down piece by piece for you.  Let’s start with Math.  When you see Math and the first letter is capitalized you know that you’re are dealing with a class in Java.  Next, we see the “.random”, this is your method, and it’s return type is a random number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).  Lastly, a little bit more about the capital M, in Math.  It means that it is a static class in Java and you don’t need to create an object first to use it.</p>

		 <p>Until next time!</p>

		<h1>Roll that Dice</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Cast a double to an int, sounds pretty technical, right? Well, in certain company talking like this might make you look like a programming genius, but really, it’s a pretty simple concept to understand.  Let’s talk about it today so you are in the “know”.  Casting a double into an int simply means you are using a cast in your code that changes one variable type to another.  So, for example, if we have some code with variable type double and need that value to be an integer we use a chunk of code that temporarily changes it into the variable type you need. What happens is cast type will simply knock off the decimal points so that your double looks like an int to the compiler.  Your next question might be, “Well, if it knocks off the decimal point(s), will the value or should the value be rounded to the nearest integer?”  The answer, a simple nope, the decimal points will simple be removed.</p>

		 <p>Why would you “cast a double to an int?” Well, let’s say that you are writing a game program that uses a dice (die) to generate a random number from 1 to 6.  We have this nifty method called Math.random that will generate that number for you the only problem is you need an integer from one to six, and Math.random gives you a double from 0.0 to 1 (0 is included, but 1 is exclusive).  What we can do is write a code with a cast type that will temporarily change the double to an int and then we can multiply it by six, and vola! We have a dice (die).    The code looks like this:  x = 1 + (int)(Math.random)*6);  The (int) is the cast type.</p>

     <p>Until next time!</p>

		<h1>Switching it up!</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Hey there, today I’m going to be writing about the differences between “switch” and “if/else” statements.  These statements are used to make decisions in your programs.  Largely, how the program will perform and what you see on the screen as a user will have been ran through one of these statements. They both compare information important to your program, but they do it in different ways.</p>

		 <p>Let’s look at some basic information about the switch statement. Switch works by calling the keyword Switch and placing a single variable into its parentheses. Then there are a bunch of cases that may have that variable assigned to it. If the computer can find a match for the variable within the cases, it will run the code associated with it. Some important things to remember with a switch statement is you want to end the case with a break.  If you do not the computer will just fall through to the next case, and the next case, and the next until it hits a break. This could cause an error in your program or if your crafty, you can use this as a feature in your program. A few other things to remember:  you can’t declare a variable in a switch statement and it’s a good idea to have a default set up in your cases in case the computer can’t find its variable match.  You can use a switch statement to figure out how many days are in the months of the year, for example. Or maybe you’re the owner of a large company and you have a list of employees, but only some of them can work on Fridays, you can use the switch statement to filter through to find your case of employee that work on Fridays. Switch statements work well if you have a lot of information to choose from. They are known to make your code neat and readable.</p>

     <p>Ah..now for the if/else statement. First off, how does it work? The if/else statement says if my condition is true, run my body code. If my conditional statement is false run my else statement body code. With the if/else statement we use Boolean operators to evaluate the expression. Based on the outcome, a specific statement will be printed on the screen.  They look like this:

     If  ( age < 18 ) {System.out.println( “You are not an adult”); }
     else {     System.out.println( “ You are an adult “); }

     If/else statement are used for about everything in computer decision making.
     I hope this cleared things up a bit for you.</p>

		<h1>To, Too, and Two</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>I don’t know if you have ever run into the various forms of equals in java, but today I’m going to do a quick break down of “=” vs “==” vs “. equals.” Confused yet?? Don’t they all mean EQUALS?? Well, yes but in different contexts. It’s kind of like two, to, and too!  I’m going tell you what each of these does and when you should use them.</p>

		 <p>You may be asking yourself, “When do I use ‘=’?”  We would use the single set of equals (=)  to set a variable equal to some sort of value. Every time that variable is called the current stored value will be used in your program.  Here are some examples of defining variables:  j = 10, feet = 12.5, children = 6, name = Jodi, a = true.  This form “=” is also called an assignment operator because it assigns a value to the variable. Use this form of equals to set a variable equal to something.</p>

     <p>Now, let’s look at the equal form “==”. This form is use to compare numbers to see if they are equivalent to each other. If the values are equivalent the program will return true. If the numbers are not equivalent to each other, then the program will return false.  These are Boolean operators, so true and false is all they will return to you. Here is an example: 4==4   evaluates to true and 3==4 evaluates to false.  You could use “==” in an “if “statement as a form of logic.  You can say if (x==y), then System.out.println(“You got it!”); . Oh, yeah, you use “==” when evaluating numbers, not strings which leads us to or last equals form “.equals.”</p>

		 <p>Lastly, we have the “.equal” form.   We use this method to evaluate strings to see if they are equivalent to each other just like “==” with numbers. This method will only evaluate to true or false, so it is a Boolean operator also. Here’s an example:  dog = dog , will evaluate to true but, dog = cat will evaluate to false. You could use this in an “if” statement also, to logic out a problem. </p>

		<h1>Going to the Library</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Hi there! Welcome to my first blog post.  Anyways, I’m going to jump right in with a set of questions that address the import java.util.Scanner.  Here are the questions:  “What happens when you included 'import java.util.Scanner;'” in your code?" "Where does the functionality come from?" Lastly, "What is the ‘java’ in the ‘java.util.Scanner?'" Okay, lets get started.</p>

		 <p>When you type in import java.util.Scanner in the first line of code you are telling java that you want to use one of its optional libraries. In this case, we want to import the Scanner that will allow users to enter input into a program via keyboard or other input source.  There are a lot of optional libraries check out this link:
		<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html</a>

     <p>The next question is: Where does the functionality come from?  It comes from the java library.  The core of the java program is small, but the external libraries let you customize your program to what you need.</p>
		 <p>Last question:  What is java in the ‘java.util.Scanner?  Okay, think of this package (java.util.Scanner) as a hierarchical set of files.  The java file holds the other classes inside of it.  So, inside the java file you will find the util class and inside the util class you will find the Scanner class!</p>

     <p>Until next time!</p>
