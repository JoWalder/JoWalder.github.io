		<h1>To, Too, and Two</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>I don’t know if you have ever run into the various forms of equals in java, but today I’m going to do a quick break down of “=” vs “==” vs “. equals.” Confused yet?? Don’t they all mean EQUALS?? Well, yes but in different contexts. It’s kind of like two, to, and too!  I’m going tell you what each of these does and when you should use them.</p>

		 <p>You may be asking yourself, “When do I use ‘=’?”  We would use the single set of equals (=)  to set a variable equal to some sort of value. Every time that variable is called the current stored value will be used in your program.  Here are some examples of defining variables:  j = 10, feet = 12.5, children = 6, name = Jodi, a = true.  This form “=” is also called an assignment operator because it assigns a value to the variable. Use this form of equals to set a variable equal to something.</p>

     <p>Now, let’s look at the equal form “==”. This form is use to compare numbers to see if they are equivalent to each other. If the values are equivalent the program will return true. If the numbers are not equivalent to each other, then the program will return false.  These are Boolean operators, so true and false is all they will return to you. Here is an example: 4==4   evaluates to true and 3==4 evaluates to false.  You could use “==” in an “if “statement as a form of logic.  You can say if (x==y), then System.out.println(“You got it!”); . Oh, yeah, you use “==” when evaluating numbers, not strings which leads us to or last equals form “.equals.”</p>

		<h2>July 14th, 2017</h2>
		<h1>Going to the Library</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Hi there! Welcome to my first blog post.  Anyways, I’m going to jump right in with a set of questions that address the import java.util.Scanner.  Here are the questions:  “What happens when you included 'import java.util.Scanner;'” in your code?" "Where does the functionality come from?" Lastly, "What is the ‘java’ in the ‘java.util.Scanner?'" Okay, lets get started.</p>

		 <p>When you type in import java.util.Scanner in the first line of code you are telling java that you want to use one of its optional libraries. In this case, we want to import the Scanner that will allow users to enter input into a program via keyboard or other input source.  There are a lot of optional libraries check out this link:
		<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html</a>

     <p>The next question is: Where does the functionality come from?  It comes from the java library.  The core of the java program is small, but the external libraries let you customize your program to what you need.</p>
		 <p>Last question:  What is java in the ‘java.util.Scanner?  Okay, think of this package (java.util.Scanner) as a hierarchical set of files.  The java file holds the other classes inside of it.  So, inside the java file you will find the util class and inside the util class you will find the Scanner class!</p>

     <p>Until next time!</p>
